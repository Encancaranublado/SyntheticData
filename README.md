# Testing the Viability of Synthetic Datasets for the Hate Speech Detection Task: A Qualitative Study

This repository contains experimentations using synthetic datasets for the Hate Speech Detection Task. This paper was motivated by earlier research done by Camilla Casula et al. (Delving into Qualitative Implications, 2024), and sought to replicate a significant part of their experiments, as well as expand on them in some areas in the search for better model performance. 

## How the synthetic data was generated

The synthetic data was generated from the MHS dataset that was used in the aforementioned paper, and is presumably taken from the work done by Pratik S. Sachdeva et al. (The Measuring Hate Speech Corpus, 2022). The replication dictated paraphrasing the instances of the MHS dataset with Mistral-7B and Mixtral 8x7B. For the expansion, we believed that the paraphrases generated by Mistral-7B and Mixtral 8x7B were not realistic enough to capture the linguistic nuances required for hate speech detection, so we employed the help of Falcon-7B to generate more realistic paraphrases of gold instances of hate speech. 

## This repository

This repository contains firstly the code used for all experimentation. It should show all of the results from the testing. This is to ensure transparency.
